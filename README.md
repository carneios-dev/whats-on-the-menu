# What's on the Menu

My final project for CS513 at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The project showcases how I cleaned the [What's on the Menu?](http://menus.nypl.org/data) data set that was made available by the New York Public Library, which documents restaurant menus and dishes from the 1850s until recent years.

**NOTE: `raw_MenuItem.csv` was trimmed a bit in order to accommodate for GitHub's filesize limitation.**
